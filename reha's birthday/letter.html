<h4> hi :) it's the coolest person here who is far more supreme than u. i just wanted to leave you a message since i can't really say it in front of your ugly (im kidding.... or am i?) face. i'm bad with words, so please bear with me. it took a lot of time to write this :') i also hope you're ready, since this letter has some cringy stuff in here. (feelings am i right) </h4>
<br>
<h4> when we first came back from distance learning, i was pretty nervous. i never talked to someone throughout quarantine, which worsened my social interaction skills. when i walked onto campus, i felt like nobody remembered me. that was until emily instantly recognized me and ran up to me. i was shocked that she still remembered what my face would look like, especially since it's been two whole years since i last saw her. not sure if the same thing happened to you. were you guys still friends during quarantine? </h4>
<br>
<h4> anyways, we all had lunch together and that was when i met you again. i have to say, looking back at it, we were so awkward IHDUIFUAOHOEW. we barely interacted with each other, so conversation lacked between us. the air was filled with tension, it was so weird. but then again, we were just friends of another friend. so that was understandable. </h4>
<br>
<h4> i think i was the one who intiated the first move. wait. i don't mean it in that romantic way. just forget i said that. what i mean was that i started making jokes to you, hoping i could get a laugh out of you. i think what really helped was when i started the whole dropkicking babies thing in pe. i think we were comparing soccer balls as babies while kicking them around? not sure if that was what happened exactly. but then you immediately bantered with me and started to hit it off. never have i thought stealing some minecraft youtuber's joke would help. </h4>
<br>
<h4> of course, some people thought i was crazy and needed a therapist (you included). some even made fun of me for it. but it was all worth it since we started talking more :)) that was what made me happy and shameless for the things i said. we quickly became best of friends, bantering with each other so much that olivia started saying that we were the enemies to lovers trope LMAOO. </h4>
<br>
<h4> in all honesty, thanks for coming into my life. without you there, i would've become a quiet sore loser. you were one of the things i was looking forward to when walking to school. in fact, you're the first friend that doesn't look at me weird whenever i say something questionable. so thanks for going along with my jokes idiot. </h4>
<br>
<h4> i still remember that time where i was sitting alone having lunch at one of the cafeteria tables. i thought no one in the friend group would care about me, but i spotted you looking for me. not sure if you still remember that moment, but it made me feel genuinely happy inside. the fact that you took your time out of the day to look made my day. </h4>
<br>
<h4> okay enough mushy stuff now. i don't want to talk about feelings anymore. now i'll proceed to call you a sussy baka for being into my mom. you're such a weirdo. no wonder my mom doesn't want to get together with YOU. meanwhile, i'm sure your mom will want to get with me ;) i mean, who doesn't want to? </h4>
<br>
<h4> happy birthday, once again. eat some cake, get some presents, and spend time with your family. make sure to tell me about it later! especially about your mom :) </h4>
<br>
<h4> cheers to another year of this crazy friendship. sincerely, </h4>
<br>
