# DISCLAMER
hello there. i have no idea why you decided to click on this. this respiratory is an online birthday gift for my friends. i usually create a website that’s dedicated to them. and that’s about it. so please click away. this isn’t for you :)

and before you ask: the only reason i have this public is because it makes it easier for web hosting. 

# SOME THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW

DO NOT TRY TO SPECULATE THE IDENTITIES OF MY FRIENDS OR ME.

seriously, don’t even try at all. that’s just straight up stalking behavior. none of us don’t appreciate you invading our privacy. leave us alone.

DON'T DOXX ME.

if you ever find out my irl identity, please don't publicly share any information online. i just want to create my birthday gifts in peace. the last thing i want is for any stalkers to find me.

# PLEASE LEAVE.
and yeah, that’s about it. go find something productive to do. click on something else and mind your own business. thanks.
